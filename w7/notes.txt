document.querySelector()
the (documents[.]) query selector 
(the () is what we would be searching for such as the TAG type ['P' or 'h1'] or ID, like in html [id = cats or #cats then in the ('#cats')] or CLASS name [class = cats ('cats')])

Ex:

var pElement = document.querySelector('#three')

Selects:

<p id="three"> :] </p> | Selects the whole thing

Call:

pElement.inerHtml=':[]' | This should set the internal face to this new face
