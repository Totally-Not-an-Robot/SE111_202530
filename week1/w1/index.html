        <p>Hey! My name is <u>Cameron</u> and I am writing about myself today! I like <b>gaming</b>, being a couch potato, hiking or just existing in the woods, and traveling. I have alot of things that interest me, but as of right now, never enough time/money/space/etc to get into them quite yet. <i>Ummmm</i>, I have a dog, her name is Kenzi (I didn't name her) and shes a chonk chocolate lab. If you have read this far, thanks for joining me!</p>
