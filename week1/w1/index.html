        <h1>Cameron Lefebve</h1>

        <p>Hey! My name is <u>Cameron</u> and I am writing about myself today! Not the most exciting of topics, had to add some spice with the exclamation marks. But I enjoy gaming on my pc, I do like DnD, but havent played it in a lonngg time, I like to hike/camp/just be in the woods, but again, not for a long time, usually if I am not gaming I am just binging a show/anime and being a lump/cave dweler. I used to read alot too, been a bit but got some good books on my shelves to whip out one day, used to binge read as well, whole like 6 book series in a few weeks. Not really a people person, honestly hate most people. I used to work a few places, but most recently was Daves Marketplace, though I messed up my wrist (probabaly permanant, <b>RIP</b>) there and that was a whole mess, but just know, I have many chips on my shoulders from that. <i>Ummmm</i>, I have a dog, her name is Kenzi (I didn't name her) and shes a chonk chocolate lab. Idk this is probably enough very high quality nonsense about me, if you've read this far I am suprised lol</p>
